    "Welcome to INFO 212: Data Science Programming I! Starting from today, we're going to be looking at the main tools and ideas in the data scientist's toolbox. We aim to learn how to write interactive programming code for extracting, cleansing, wrangling, transforming, reshaping, and analyzing data. We will mainly use Python programming language in the Jupyter notebook environment. However, to be productive in loading, processing, and keeping track of data and analyses, we should also be proficient at using scripts such as linux command line, version control, and git. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first course in the the sequence of data science programming offering. In this course, we will cover various Python packages for high performance data analysis and visualization including numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, etc. In the second course, we will study the primary python package, scikit-learn,  for building basic predictive models to solve some data challenge problems. \n",

For a code cell, you can treat it as a text editor. Running the cells by yourself would help you cement your understanding of the concepts we're talking about. Once you've written the code to in a cell, you can run the code by clicking inside the cell (box with code in it) with the code you want to run and then hit CTRL + ENTER. \n",

    "Let us load a real data set into a Python Pandas DataFrame object and take a first look at the data. The first thing we'll need to do is to load in the libraries (we have done it in the cell above, so we don't need to repeat it). For the data set, for today, we'll be using a dataset about the Titanic passengers. The data set contains various information about passengers boarding on the Titanic ship. This data set comes from the Kaggle data science get-started competition: [Titanic Suvival Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). We will use the training data set called train.csv. the extension 'csv' indicates that the data is formated as comma separated values (Hence, csv). 'CSV' files are the standard ways for save and load data in data analytics tasks.\n",
